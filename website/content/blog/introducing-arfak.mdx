We're excited to introduce Arfak, an open-source personal AI assistant designed to put you in control.

## Why Arfak?

Most AI assistants today live in the cloud. Your conversations, your data, your habits — all stored on someone else's servers. Arfak takes a different approach: **you own everything**.

- **Run it anywhere** — your laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or a VPS. No vendor lock-in.
- **Fully private** — zero telemetry, zero cloud calls by default.
- **Extensible** — a plugin system that lets you connect any tool or API you already use.

## What Can It Do?

Out of the box, Arfak ships with a core set of capabilities:

1. **Natural-language chat** with configurable LLM backends
2. **File and document understanding** for local knowledge bases
3. **Task automation** through composable plugins
4. **Multi-modal input** including voice and images

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run three commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tianzhou/arfak.git
cd arfak
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

That's it. Open `http://localhost:3000` and start chatting.

## What's Next

We have an ambitious roadmap ahead — better plugin APIs, a marketplace for community extensions, and first-class mobile support. Follow along on [GitHub](https://github.com/tianzhou/arfak) and help us shape the future of personal AI.
