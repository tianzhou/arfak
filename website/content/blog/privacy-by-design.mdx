Privacy isn't an afterthought in Arfak. It's the foundation everything else is built on.

## The Problem with Cloud AI

Every time you send a message to a cloud-hosted assistant, you're trusting a third party with:

- The content of your conversations
- Metadata about when and how often you interact
- Any files or documents you upload

Even with strong privacy policies, data breaches happen. Regulations change. Companies get acquired.

## Our Approach

Arfak is designed around three principles:

### 1. Local-First Processing

All inference happens on your machine by default. Your prompts never leave your device unless you explicitly configure an external provider.

### 2. Zero Telemetry

There are no analytics endpoints, no crash reporters, no usage beacons. We don't know how many people use Arfak — and that's by design.

### 3. Transparent Data Storage

Every piece of data Arfak stores lives in a human-readable format on your filesystem. No opaque databases, no binary blobs. You can inspect, export, or delete your data at any time with standard tools.

## When You *Want* the Cloud

Sometimes you need a more powerful model than what runs locally. Arfak supports optional cloud providers, but with guardrails:

- **Explicit opt-in** — cloud backends are never enabled silently
- **Per-conversation control** — choose which conversations use cloud and which stay local
- **Provider agnostic** — swap between providers without losing your conversation history

## Trust Through Transparency

Arfak is open source. Every line of code is auditable. If you don't trust our claims, you can verify them yourself — and we encourage it.
